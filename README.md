This project explores trending YouTube videos in France to uncover what drives content visibility and audience engagement. Using a dataset of over 40,000 video entries, we analyzed metrics like views, likes, comments, and category trends. The insights are presented using a Setup → Conflict → Resolution storytelling approach.

Key findings include the dominance of Entertainment and Music categories, while others like Science & Tech are rarely seen. Some videos with high views had low engagement, indicating possible clickbait. Interestingly, longer trending duration didn’t always mean higher views. Sentiment analysis also revealed that emotionally charged titles led to more comments and interaction.

Overall, this project highlights how content type, timing, and emotional appeal influence YouTube trends—offering creators and marketers actionable insights beyond surface-level metrics.
